Under City Charter, the Treasurer of the City of Los Angeles is the chief administrative officer of the City Treasury and custodian of record for more than $7 billion in City funds. In 2011, the Treasurer’s Office was moved under the Director of Finance, who holds both titles. As a part of our review, we assessed the City’s investment program performance in terms of maximizing returns while complying with provisions of the Government Code, and evaluated the benchmarks and measurement practices employed and the manner and method of reporting the results. We also reviewed the City’s cash flow forecasting methods and use of information systems as well as the City’s organizational structure, access to external experts, and utilization of oversight and control processes. Overall, we found that the City’s investment activities reflect positive returns and its investing processes were reasonable and complete.\n\n\"The City manages two portfolios, the Core and Reserve Portfolios.  The results of our analyses reveal that the Core Portfolio outperformed its chosen benchmark in each of the four periods (calendar and fiscal years, 2011 and 2012) that we reviewed. The Reserve Portfolio slightly outperformed its benchmark for three of the four periods analyzed. Additionally, we noted that the benchmark indices the City uses for comparative purposes are similar to those used by a number of other peer municipalities.\"",

As of August 31, 2012, the bank balances were $354,351 and $792,925 for the Public Works and Figueroa Plaza building maintenance accounts, respectively.\n\nThe purpose of our review was to evaluate internal controls over GSD's bank accounts and to determine whether GSD used the funds in accordance with their authorized purposes.\n\nThe bank accounts were used in accordance with their authorized purposes; specifically, for the Property Manager (CBRE) to process vendor payments related to the operations and maintenance of the two City-owned properties, subject to the review, approval and signature by GSD.\n\nWhile all check disbursements were supported, we noted minor observations related to GSD's documentary review requirements. However, we question the necessity of GSD maintaining these bank accounts, as the processes for detailed payment review are duplicated between CBRE and GSD. The agreement with CBRE requires they maintain separate and sufficient accounting records to support all disbursements; this function is supported through their monthly management fee. In addition, CBRE is required to manage expenditures within an established budget that has been approved by GSD, and expenditures over a certain dollar limit require GSD's prior written approval.\n\nTo streamline City operations while ensuring appropriate oversight and control of the property management function for these buildings, we recommend that GSD execute a new contract(s) for property management services that simplifies payment processing and eliminates the need for these City bank accounts that are outside the control of the Treasurer's Office. Under the terms of a new contract, CBRE could continue to receive a monthly management fee and be reimbursed for other direct expenditures, in accordance with an established budget.",

We also reviewed an $800 petty cash fund maintained by the Zoo in a Wells Fargo bank account.\n\nWe counted a total of $25,134.89, comprised of change funds of $18,127.46, daily collections of $6,495, and petty cash funds of $512.43.

Under City Charter, the Treasurer of the City of Los Angeles is the chief administrative officer of the City Treasury and custodian of record for more than $7 billion in City funds. In 2011, the Treasurer’s Office was moved under the Director of Finance, who holds both titles. As a part of our review, we assessed the City’s investment program performance in terms of maximizing returns while complying with provisions of the Government Code, and evaluated the benchmarks and measurement practices employed and the manner and method of reporting the results. We also reviewed the City’s cash flow forecasting methods and use of information systems as well as the City’s organizational structure, access to external experts, and utilization of oversight and control processes. Overall, we found that the City’s investment activities reflect positive returns and its investing processes were reasonable and complete.\n\n\"The City manages two portfolios, the Core and Reserve Portfolios.  The results of our analyses reveal that the Core Portfolio outperformed its chosen benchmark in each of the four periods (calendar and fiscal years, 2011 and 2012) that we reviewed. The Reserve Portfolio slightly outperformed its benchmark for three of the four periods analyzed. Additionally, we noted that the benchmark indices the City uses for comparative purposes are similar to those used by a number of other peer municipalities.\""

State and federal laws require the confiscation and forfeiture of all contraband— property that is illegal to possess per se. Other laws authorize the seizure and forfeiture of private property that is used in an extensive array of crimes. Therefore, LAPD may seize real and personal property that is used in a crime, and after a legal forfeiture process, may use the proceeds or the property itself to enhance law enforcement activities.\n\nCrimes for which LAPD dedicates staff resources towards pursuing asset forfeitures include only those that involve illegal drugs or money laundering, through the designated activities of personnel assigned to the Asset Forfeiture Investigative Detail of the Gangs and Narcotics Division. LAPD works independently or with other local, State, or federal authorities to file forfeiture cases—nearly all of which involve seizures of cash—with the Los Angeles County District Attorney or with the U.S. Attorney.\n\nDuring 2012 LAPD’s Asset Forfeiture Investigative Detail (AFID) reported the initiation of more than 500 forfeiture cases involving nearly $21 million in cash. Federal guides describe how LAPD may participate in federal asset forfeiture cases and qualify to receive as much as an 80% “equitable share” of the forfeited assets. Asset forfeitures resulting from violations of State law result in LAPD receiving a 65% share of forfeited assets. While AFID initiates asset forfeiture cases, accounting for the financial proceeds of asset forfeitures is the task of LAPD’s Fiscal Operations Division (FOD). Together, AFID and FOD comprise LAPD’s Asset Forfeiture Program (Program), whose activities were the focus of this audit. This performance audit was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards and covered LAPD’s asset seizure and forfeiture activities during 2011 and 2012. Audit fieldwork was conducted between October 2012 and March 2013."

The investigation originated from two complaints reported to the Controller's Fraud Hotline, each alleging payroll breaches. One complaint reported the six-month long usage and approval of sick leave and family medical leave benefits for a sworn LAPD employee without having medical necessity. The complainant alleged that the employee was living out-of-state and seeking new employment during the six-month period. A second complaint reported that a non-sworn LAPD employee consistently works during the day while receiving a night-shift bonus payment.\n\nOur review found that a lack of LAPD. supervisory adherence to payroll policies and procedures led to two separate MOU breaches resulting in payroll overpayments to LAPD employees. A now former LAPD employee received $41,243 in sick leave and family medical leave benefits over a six-month period without providing information or documentation detailing an illness or medical necessity. During that period the individual also received holiday pay and continuation of City benefits. In addition, the now former LAPD employee was concurrently employed by an out-of-state police department while receiving City paid leave. Another LAPD employee has been receiving bonus payments for non-qualifying work.

We also evaluated the Department’s fleet management practices to identify opportunities to improvement. LAWA maintains a fleet of over 1,400 items including cars, trucks, motorcycles, and heavy equipment. This audit focused on light duty sedans, trucks, vans, and motorcycles that are maintained by LAWA, as categorized below: No. of Vehicles Home-Garaged Vehicles 84, Central Pool Vehicles 81, Vehicles Assigned to Divisions 651, Vehicles Assigned to Airport Police 213, Total 1,029.\n\nWe focused our review on LAWA’s passenger vehicles (e.g., light duty sedans, trucks and vans) that are being used to perform critical functions and support services in the areas of administration, airport operations, grounds and facility maintenance, engineering and construction, and security and law enforcement.\n\nThis performance audit included the current control structure and processes used to manage LAWA’s vehicle fleet, and sample transactions and activities from July 1, 2010 to October 31, 2012. Audit fieldwork was conducted between October 2012 and January 2013.\nSUMMARY OF AUDIT RESULTS Over the last two years LAWA has purchased light-duty vehicles totaling more than $2 million. Additional costs are incurred for maintenance and fuel for the vehicle fleet.\n\nOverall, our audit found that there is inadequate centralized accountability or control over the vehicles that are assigned to staff with authority for home-garaging and those allocated to LAWA Divisions and other pools. We noted that the inventory information produced by the fleet system was inaccurate, and LAWA has no utilization standard or process to evaluate the need for or best use of its existing vehicles. Divisional pool vehicles are routinely assigned to individuals, limiting their effective use by other staff, and some employees who use their personal vehicle due to a shortage of available pool cars have been paid excessive mileage reimbursements. In addition, there is inadequate control over the vehicle replacement process. LAWA should take immediate action to improve controls over its vehicle fleet, as well as maximize the usage of those assets and reduce overall costs."

The firm of Vasquez & Company LLP (Vasquez) was engaged by the Los Angeles City Controller’s Office to conduct a performance audit to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of LAWA’s financial operations, and identify opportunities for improvement. The audit focused on internal controls, processes, personnel and systems relevant to its core financial activities.\n\nLAWA is responsible for the physical elements of the airports it operates, which include runways, fueling facilities, passenger terminals and ground transportation facilities. From these capital assets LAWA generates revenues in the form of aircraft landing fees, lease fees, concession fees from tenants and parking fees. As a self-supporting department with no tax base, these revenues must be sufficient to fund LAWA’s operating, maintenance and capital expenses, debt service and required reserves. Annual revenues and capital grants for LAWA were approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2012, while expenses were $809 million, resulting in an increase in net assets of approximately $279 million.\n\nThe primary objective of the audit was to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of LAWA’s financial operations, and identify opportunities for improvement. Our audit was performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and covered conditions, activities and processes as of June 30, 2011, with consideration given to current conditions when considered relevant to the conclusions reached.\n\nOverall we found that LAWA’s policies and procedures pertaining to core financial activities are comparable to those found in a governmental enterprise environment, and are generally up-todate and communicated to appropriate personnel. The organization structure provides for key functions and reasonable reporting relationships. Personnel interviewed possessed qualifications commensurate with their roles and demonstrated an adequate understanding of their responsibilities.

The investigation originated from a complaint reported to the Controller's Office expressing concerns that CCTV trucks had been unused for several years. The complaint also included information regarding the rental of SUVs for WCSD staff in lieu of utilizing existing BOS aSSigned fleet vehicles, which was also characterized as a waste of City resources. This report provides my conclusions from investigating those complaints. The WCSD operates and maintains the City's wastewater collection system which consists of over 6,500 miles of sewers. CCTV inspections are primarily conducted to assess the condition of sewer pipes subsequent to cleaning to detect potential blockages. A 2004 legal settlement mandated BOS to conduct 600 miles of sewer inspections on an annual basis. BOS has had continuous personal services contracts for CCTV inspections of City sewer pipelines since at least 2002.\n\nOne objective of this investigation was to evaluate 80S CCTV pilot program equipment purchases, utilization and program staffing. A second objective was to review and evaluate 80S' plan to lease SUVs with maintenance contracts under a forthcoming pilot program rather than purchasing new vehicles.\n\nThis review has brought to light the need for City managers to focus on the expected full cost impact prior to initiating any pilot program.

The objectives of the examination were to (i) assess the reasonableness of the proposed costs, (ii) determine the adequacy of the accounting system in accumulating costs under the proposed contract, (iii) evaluate the financial capability of HNTB and the 4 major subcontractors listed above.\n\nBased on our examination, we found that:\n\n• Costs proposed by HNTB were higher by $2,049,762 than the audit recommended costs. We recommend that the City of Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering (“BOE”) utilize the audited costs in its negotiations with HNTB.\n\nAs discussed in this report, our examination was limited to verification of proposed labor rates, overhead rates, mark-ups and unit costs used for other direct expense items. We did not verify the reasonableness of the proposed hours, mileages, number of copies or similar units of measurement utilized in the proposals. These were utilized in the examination merely to compare the total proposed, audited and recommended costs.\n\n• Documentation supporting the cost proposal was not adequate to determine whether the proposed overhead rates can be sustained by HNTB or its 4 major subcontractors for the 6- year period of contract performance. The City of Los Angeles risks overpaying on the contract if HNTB and its subcontractors’ actual overhead rates become lower during the period of contract performance. We recommend that the BOE consider utilizing a Cost-plus fixed-fee contract with a not-to-exceed amount for this project. In addition, we recommend that BOE consider capping the indirect expense rate to protect the City from unexpected increases in overhead rates.\n\n• Based on our evaluation, we found that HNTB and its 4 major subcontractors accounting and billing systems were adequate to identify, account for, record, and accumulate costs in proper costs pools.\n\n• Based on our analysis of key ratios, we found that HNTB and its 4 majors subcontractors are financially capable to perform on the proposed contract. Our evaluation of financial capability was based solely on the review of the most recent financial statements and not on financial projections. Therefore, certain events may occur during the performance of this 6-year project that might impact the key financial ratios of HNTB or its 4 major subcontractors. BACKGROUND\n\nThe Sixth Street Viaduct Replacement Project (“Project”) of the City of Los Angeles will replace the existing viaduct which was constructed in 1932. In April 2012, the City of Los Angeles BOE issued a Request for Qualifications to begin the process of selecting a design consultant for the Project. In October 2012, the BOE announced the selection of HNTB as the design consultant that will provide comprehensive design and support services through the final design, right-of-way and construction phases. The proposed contract is anticipated to be negotiated as a firm fixed-priced contract with estimated total costs of $27M and the expected period of performance is 6 years. The total estimated cost includes 14 subcontractors totaling $6.6M.\n\nThe objectives of the examination were to (i) assess the reasonableness of the proposed costs, (ii) determine the adequacy of the accounting system in accumulating costs under the proposed contract, (iii) evaluate the financial capability of HNTB and its 4 major subcontractors.\n"

State and federal laws require the confiscation and forfeiture of all contraband— property that is illegal to possess per se. Other laws authorize the seizure and forfeiture of private property that is used in an extensive array of crimes. Therefore, LAPD may seize real and personal property that is used in a crime, and after a legal forfeiture process, may use the proceeds or the property itself to enhance law enforcement activities.\n\nCrimes for which LAPD dedicates staff resources towards pursuing asset forfeitures include only those that involve illegal drugs or money laundering, through the designated activities of personnel assigned to the Asset Forfeiture Investigative Detail of the Gangs and Narcotics Division. LAPD works independently or with other local, State, or federal authorities to file forfeiture cases—nearly all of which involve seizures of cash—with the Los Angeles County District Attorney or with the U.S. Attorney.\n\nDuring 2012 LAPD’s Asset Forfeiture Investigative Detail (AFID) reported the initiation of more than 500 forfeiture cases involving nearly $21 million in cash. Federal guides describe how LAPD may participate in federal asset forfeiture cases and qualify to receive as much as an 80% “equitable share” of the forfeited assets. Asset forfeitures resulting from violations of State law result in LAPD receiving a 65% share of forfeited assets. While AFID initiates asset forfeiture cases, accounting for the financial proceeds of asset forfeitures is the task of LAPD’s Fiscal Operations Division (FOD). Together, AFID and FOD comprise LAPD’s Asset Forfeiture Program (Program), whose activities were the focus of this audit. This performance audit was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards and covered LAPD’s asset seizure and forfeiture activities during 2011 and 2012.

The complainant alleged that the employee was living out-of-state and seeking new employment during the six-month period. A second complaint reported that a non-sworn LAPD employee consistently works during the day while receiving a night-shift bonus payment.\n\nOur review found that a lack of LAPD. supervisory adherence to payroll policies and procedures led to two separate MOU breaches resulting in payroll overpayments to LAPD employees. A now former LAPD employee received $41,243 in sick leave and family medical leave benefits over a six-month period without providing information or documentation detailing an illness or medical necessity.

We also evaluated the Department’s fleet management practices to identify opportunities to improvement. LAWA maintains a fleet of over 1,400 items including cars, trucks, motorcycles, and heavy equipment. This audit focused on light duty sedans, trucks, vans, and motorcycles that are maintained by LAWA, as categorized below: No. of Vehicles Home-Garaged Vehicles 84, Central Pool Vehicles 81, Vehicles Assigned to Divisions 651, Vehicles Assigned to Airport Police 213, Total 1,029.\n\nWe focused our review on LAWA’s passenger vehicles (e.g., light duty sedans, trucks and vans) that are being used to perform critical functions and support services in the areas of administration, airport operations, grounds and facility maintenance, engineering and construction, and security and law enforcement.\n\nThis performance audit included the current control structure and processes used to manage LAWA’s vehicle fleet, and sample transactions and activities from July 1, 2010 to October 31, 2012. Audit fieldwork was conducted between October 2012 and January 2013.\nSUMMARY OF AUDIT RESULTS Over the last two years LAWA has purchased light-duty vehicles totaling more than $2 million. Additional costs are incurred for maintenance and fuel for the vehicle fleet.\n\nOverall, our audit found that there is inadequate centralized accountability or control over the vehicles that are assigned to staff with authority for home-garaging and those allocated to LAWA Divisions and other pools. We noted that the inventory information produced by the fleet system was inaccurate, and LAWA has no utilization standard or process to evaluate the need for or best use of its existing vehicles.

The firm of Vasquez & Company LLP (Vasquez) was engaged by the Los Angeles City Controller’s Office to conduct a performance audit to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of LAWA’s financial operations, and identify opportunities for improvement. The audit focused on internal controls, processes, personnel and systems relevant to its core financial activities.\n\nLAWA is responsible for the physical elements of the airports it operates, which include runways, fueling facilities, passenger terminals and ground transportation facilities. From these capital assets LAWA generates revenues in the form of aircraft landing fees, lease fees, concession fees from tenants and parking fees. As a self-supporting department with no tax base, these revenues must be sufficient to fund LAWA’s operating, maintenance and capital expenses, debt service and required reserves. Annual revenues and capital grants for LAWA were approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2012, while expenses were $809 million, resulting in an increase in net assets of approximately $279 million.\n\nThe primary objective of the audit was to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of LAWA’s financial operations, and identify opportunities for improvement. Our audit was performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and covered conditions, activities and processes as of June 30, 2011, with consideration given to current conditions when considered relevant to the conclusions reached.\n\nOverall we found that LAWA’s policies and procedures pertaining to core financial activities are comparable to those found in a governmental enterprise environment, and are generally up-todate and communicated to appropriate personnel.

The incremental parking revenue credit is the focus of this report.

Our examination revealed that the statement of net incremental parking revenue credits was not in conformity with the criteria described in Note 3 of Tab 1.\n\nDuring the planning phase of the engagement identified in tab 1, we determined that we would be unable to render an unqualified examination report because of the following reasons:\n1. LACC did not have all records since the inception of the GAP Funding agreement in 1998 to the present readily available for our inspection.\n2. LACC had not implemented a methodology to allocate expenses internally, neither manually nor automatically through the accounting system, to their parking operations or Staples Center revenues.\n3. LACC had not identified the costs being incurred by other City departments on behalf of LACC that should have been allocated to the Staples Center parking revenues.\n4.

This included determining whether there have been plans to modify the contract, if necessary, to ensure that ADPI would not be compensated additional fees as a result of the legislative change. We also reviewed budgeted AB- 678 revenues for reasonableness.\n\nThe scope of this audit was limited to examining whether the City’s contract for emergency medical service billing and collection provides sufficient protection to ensure the City receives the full benefit of this legislative change, and whether the AB-678 revenue estimate that was programmed into the FY 2012-13 budget deliberations was reasonable.\n\nWe found that the current contract does not clearly indicate whether AB-678 revenues should be included or excluded from net collections used to compute fees paid to ADPI. In order to adequately protect the City from any future disputes, the City’s contract with ADPI should be amended to specifically exclude AB-678 revenues from net collections used to compute ADPI’s fees.\n\nIn addition, we found that the Los Angeles Fire Department’s (LAFD) estimated $10 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2012-13 AB-678 revenues appears reasonable. However, because the AB-678 program implementation guidelines have not yet been finalized, the City may not receive the $10 million during this fiscal year. Furthermore, $5 million in anticipated productivity gains from outsourced ambulance billing functions may not materialize. Since the $15 million was programmed into the City’s General Fund FY 2012-13 budget, we recommend that City officials evaluate the impact on the General Fund, and if necessary, identify alternative options to cover the shortfall should the $15 million fail to materialize.\n", "Contract Analysis", "Fire Prevention and Emergency Preparedness", "Revenue", [ "http://controller.lacity.org/Audits_and_Reports/ssLINK/LACITYP_024315", null ], [ "http://controller.lacity.org/Audits_and_Reports/ssLINK/LACITYP_024676", null ], [ "http://controller.lacity.org/Audits_and_Reports/ssLINK/LACITYP_024735", null ], "13-19" ]

However, we noted that DOT inadequately tracked and monitored refund checks issued with corresponding replenishments. Also, based on our surprise count of the cash portion of the Petty Cash Fund, we noted a shortage of $300 in cash, most likely due to theft.\n\nDuring our review, we discovered a cash loss of $300 which was part of the authorized Petty Cash Funds, and we noted weaknesses in monitoring/replenishing the Bail Refund Account.
